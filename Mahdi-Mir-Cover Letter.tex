My name's Mahdi; I have a strong background in statistics and data analysis,
and have been using Stata for several years to conduct research and complete
data projects. I am well-versed in a variety of Stata commands and techniques,
and have experience working with large datasets. In addition, I have experience creating Stata scripts and macros,
which allows me to automate repetitive tasks and make my work more efficient.

\par

More about my programming skills, I Also, have an excellent experience with Python,
working with databases, deep learning models, image processing, statistical
analyses, and almost all sorts of things in Python.

\par

Recently, I graduated with a Master's in Theoretical Economics from TeIAS (Tehran
Institute for Advanced Studies, the leading economic/financial research institute
in Iran). I've been researching Economics \&
also doing RA jobs at TeIAS for the last three years. I have been the RA of Mahdi Heidari for almost 30 months, also I've done RA jobs
with Hamed Davari from the university of Mannheim, Germany, for 4 months, moreover, I have an ongoing RA job with Javad Shamsi from LSE, UK.
\\
Before my Maser's in Economics, I graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department
of Sharif university of technology, which is a renowned department worldwide.
I enhanced my mathematical \& quantitative skills during these years.

\par

I have done so many projects in  \textbf{Stata}, \textbf{Python}, \textbf{Julia}
and \textbf{R}. As an example of my works, I extracted share-holding data from
Iranian mutual funds’ reports’ images, which is brave new nationwide.
I used image processing methods, the TableNet deep learning model with some
adjustments, and the Google Tesseract engine for this job.
I currently have a job offer in hand from the Agah brokerage's quantitative branch
to extend this work to other sorts of financial/economic data. In Iran, most of
the accurate data are jailed in reports and printed tables that are never
digitilized systematically. Also, Agah is the second-largest brokerage in the
country; and they have acknowledged my work and offered me without my application
for the job. But I prefer to continue my academic path.

\par

I believe that my previous quantitative \& mathematical skills,
as well as my excellence in programming with Stata \& Python,
makes me the right candidate for the predoctoral position at Kellogg.
\\
I love learning, researching \& coding, especially in the area of economics.
I hope to work on research projects to strengthen
my skills \& deepen my knowledge so I can develop my research agenda and apply
for a Ph.D. in economics at a leading institution/university.

Please review my CV for additional details regarding my expertise and
achievements. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further
clarification on my experience. I would love to meet with you and discuss the position in
detail.
